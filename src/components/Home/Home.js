                Code Ideology is an inclusive and collaborative process, a mindset, an attitude that brings people together to create positive changes in a place or area.

                It aims to improve not only the physical elements of a space, but also the way people think about and connect with the world around them.

                It is a response to the car-dominated, unattractive and unsafe environments found in many urban areas, but it also has ancient roots reaching back to the way communities and citizens used to be created pre-World War 2.

                Code Ideology is not a "nice to have", it's a "must do"!



                We have collected ï»¿and curated the most important Code Ideology concepts, tips and lessons learned into one place to make it easier and faster for you to learn.
